Away from Keyboard is a new show from Changelog that talks to creative professionals about how they do what they do, where they started, and how they deal with the things that make us all humans.

As exciting as our work can sometimes be, we all face burnout, a lack of motivation, mental and physical health issues, and more. While these are topics that can be difficult to talk about, our experiences shape who we are and teach us so many things. AFK is a show that explores the human side of creative work.
