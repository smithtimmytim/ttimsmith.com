  <p class="resume__statement">My name is Tim Smith, and I’m a frontend designer based in St. Paul, Minnesota. I bridge the gap between designers and back-end developers.</p>

  <p>I started out as a graphic designer back in 2009. Over time, I’ve found myself interested in writing front-end code. My eye for design helps me markup sites and interfaces the way designers intended.</p>

  <p>My ideal role allows me to create sites and interfaces by writing standards-based markup and CSS, foster collaboration between engineering and design teams, and help maintain or create a styleguide for UI components and front-end markup.</p>
