## What I'm Great At

### UX & UI Design

Great design is the result of well-formulated questions to the right people. I base my concepts on user reasearch, an effort to understand the complete picture—not just a specific piece of an app or site—and goals of the business.


### Frontend Development

I write standards-based HTML and CSS, together with some JavaScript. I’ve worked extensively with both Ruby on Rails, and WordPress (which might be the weirdest combo ever).

### Workshops & Talks

If you’re an educator, a manager, or a conference organizer, I’m a great teacher. I can speak on a wide range of topics, like design, development, growing remote teams, and more. [Read more on the speaking page](/speaking/).


## How I Work

1. **Week by Week Basis**  
Instead of setting random deadlines for a project, we sit down on Monday and define what we’ll accomplish within that week.
2. **One Project at a Time**  
Many independent designers and developers work on more than one project concurrently. I don’t. I only work with one client at a time. You have my full attention and time.
3. **The Right Technology for You**  
I have a wide range of technological expertise. We work together to decide the right technology for your site or app. I’m not into fitting square pegs into round holes.
