I"€<p>So, Iâ€™ve got a brand new siteâ€¦ again. It almost seems that Iâ€™m redesigning this crap too much. But, the truth is, there are always better ways to solve problems and I strive to do that with all of my work, even my personal stuff.</p>

<p>With that said, the site I had up before honestly looked a bit amateurish. I donâ€™t know what I was thinking. I mean, it did only take about two hours to design and code it up so, that might explain things a bit. Either way, moving forward, there were a couple of things I wanted to get better at.</p>

<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adip*isicing elit, sed do eiusmod *tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.</p>

<h2 id="my-work">My Work</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, a lot of work that Iâ€™ve done is restricted by NDAâ€™s and thatâ€™s all great when youâ€™re working on these exciting projects but, when it comes time to display them, itâ€™s horrible. Therefore, at the moment I can only show snippets of my work for which <a href="https://dribbble.com/smithtimmytim">Dribbble</a> has been super useful. For now, that wonâ€™t change. But the truth is though, my design isnâ€™t the only thing Iâ€™m working on at the moment. I have a pretty cool podcast called <del>Laugh If You Want Too</del> and a soon to be podcast called <del>The East Wing</del> which is going to be awesome.</p>

<p>Having said that, I wanted this new design to give people the opportunity to see all of my stuff. I know Iâ€™m no internet celebrity but, if youâ€™re interested, now you can find it. Which reminds me <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;rant&gt;</code> Iâ€™m no internet celebrity and I probably will never be but, why canâ€™t people reply to tweets of us unknown peeps? I donâ€™t get it. Maybe youâ€™re too busy or you donâ€™t care for the people that admire your work. Who knows. One thing is true though, if you want to talk and interact with me, Iâ€™ll always reply. To know who you are, you gotta know where you came from. <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;/rant&gt;</code></p>

<h2 id="writing-again">Writing Again</h2>

<p>Iâ€™m happy to report that my writing juices seem to be flowing again which is why I dedicated more time to the design of this site. I want to have somewhere to pour some of my thoughts. As I grow as a designer and a person, I find it essential to share the small bits of wisdom you find along the way. Again, it may not be a lot; I still have much to learn in design and in life but, Iâ€™ll always be thankful to those that helped me when I was starting out. Itâ€™s about time I pay that forward.</p>

<h2 id="thank-you">Thank You</h2>

<p>I just want to extend a huge thank you to those whom have supported me and have been interested in the different things I do. I also want to extend a thank you to <a href="https://andytaylor.me/">Andy Taylor</a>, the creator of the <del>1140px CSS Grid</del>; itâ€™s the reason why making this site responsive was a cinch! Check it out if you havenâ€™t already! Also, I big thank you to <a href="http://kennedysgarage.com/">Kennedy</a>, who took me out of a bind and helped me figure out how to change the color of a placeholder in a form.</p>

<p>Also, youâ€™ll notice that this blog is proudly brought to you by <a href="https://carbonads.net/">Carbon Ads</a>. Adelle and her team are awesome and always on the look out for great companies for their network. Do yourself a favor and click on some of these ads. Yes, youâ€™d be helping me make some money, but youâ€™d be getting in some awesome products as well.</p>

<p>As always, thank you for reading and if you have thoughts youâ€™d like to share, give me a shout on <a href="https://twitter.com/smithtimmytim">Twitter</a>.</p>
