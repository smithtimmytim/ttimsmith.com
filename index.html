    <h1>Hi there!</h1>
    <h2>I’m Tim Smith, a Latino designer and frontend developer from Saint Paul, MN.</h2>

    <p>It was ten years ago that I started teaching myself this “web design” thing. In that time, I’ve been privileged to work with companies large and small including <a href="https://www.relay.fm/">Relay FM</a>, <a href="https://carbonads.net/">Carbon Ads</a>, <a href="https://andyet.com/">&amp;Yet</a>, <a href="https://www.lullabot.com/">Lullabot</a>, <a href="http://crushlovely.com/">Crush &amp; Lovely</a>, and The Clinton Foundation.</p>

    <p>In 2013, I started <a href="https://theboldreport.net"><em>The Bold Report</em></a>, my writing place for design, development, Star Wars, and more. My writing has been published on <a href="https://alistapart.com"><em>A List Apart</em></a>, <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/net-magazine"><em>Net Magazine</em></a>, and <a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/"><em>UX Booth</em></a> among others.</p>

    <p>I love speaking and leading workshops. I’d love to speak at your event too. <a href="/speaking/">Take a look at other events I’ve spoken at</a> and get in touch.</p>
