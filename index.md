Currently, I'm the Senior Producer at [Changelog Media](https://changelog.com/), a company that creates podcasts for web and software developers. When away from my desk, I spend time with my amazing partner-in-crime Kelly, eating brunch, watching movies, walking the mall, and other sappy-sounding couple stuff.
