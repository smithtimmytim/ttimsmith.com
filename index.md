My days are spent finding awesome creative people at [BuySellAds](https://www.buysellads.com/). I'm the creator of [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pics/), an Instagram alternative to share photos with friends and family privately. On my free time, [I love to write](https://timmmmy.blog/), [make YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/smithtimmytim), [read comics](https://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/profile/smithtimmytim), [watch movies](https://letterboxd.com/ttimsmith/), play board games, or spend time naked near water.
