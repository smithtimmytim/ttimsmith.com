I'm currently building [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pics), a better way to share photos with friends and family. In 2013, I started a blog now called [_Brightly Colored_](https://brightlycolored.org/), a web-column about about comic books, _Star Wars_, technology, and other geekery. When away from my keyboard, I spend time with my wonderful partner, Kelly.
