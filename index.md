I'm currently the Senior Producer at [Changelog Media](https://changelog.com/). I produce [_Away from Keyboard_](https://changelog.com/afk), a show exploring the human side of creative work. In 2013, I started a blog now called [_Brightly Colored_](https://brightlycolored.org/), a web-column about about comic books, _Star Wars_, technology, and other geekery. When away from _my_ keyboard, I spend time with my wonderful partner, Kelly.
