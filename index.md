I'm the Senior Producer at [Changelog Media](https://changelog.com/), a company that creates podcasts for web and software developers. I produce *[Away from Keyboard](https://changelog.com/afk)*, a show exploring the human side of creative work. When away from *my* keyboard, I spend time with my partner-in-crime, Kelly.
