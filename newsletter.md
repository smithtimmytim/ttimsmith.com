Periodically, I send out a newsletter. *When there's something important to share*, you'll hear from me. This turns out to be about ten or less times a year.

If you're curious, [here's what a typical email from me looks like](https://anythingoes.createsend.com/campaigns/reports/viewCampaign.aspx?d=t&c=AFB42C46D41EA631&ID=8067BD2E8C51732A&temp=False&tx=0). **Your information is never shared.**

Thanks for being interested in me and my projects.
