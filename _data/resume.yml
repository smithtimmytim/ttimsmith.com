      My name is Tim Smith, and I’m a frontend designer based in St. Paul, Minnesota. I bridge the gap between designers and back-end developers.

      I started out as a graphic designer back in 2009. Over time, I’ve found myself interested in writing front-end code. My eye for design helps me markup sites and interfaces the way designers intended.

      My ideal role allows me to create sites and interfaces by writing standards-based markup and CSS, foster collaboration between engineering and design teams, and help maintain or create a styleguide for UI components and front-end markup.
