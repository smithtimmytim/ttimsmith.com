              <h2>Add Shows Easily</h2>
              <p>Podcast networks are usually more than one or two shows. Adding new shows, and setting up RSS feeds that are compatible with iTunes, should be easy. On-Air let’s you upload artwork, add a description, add a host, add a producer, add a newsletter, and so much more.</p>

              <h2>Manage Guests, Hosts &amp; Admins</h2>
              <p>You’re a network owner, and posting shows for your hosts can get tiring. With On-Air, managing hosts and guests, is a breeze. You can quickly give each person different levels of access, and even display a publicly viewable page with their bio, shows they host, and guest appearances.</p>

                The CMS built for Goodstuff took all the usual work that’s required to publish a podcast on the web and lets me focus on simply recording podcasts. Not having to worry about re-entering metadata through iTunes’ constantly changing interfaces, making sure links are saved properly during recordings or even that the MP3 file is in the right location on the web are all things I don't have to worry about thanks to the CMS built by Tim Smith.

              <h2>Link Bookmarklet</h2>
              <p>Show notes and links are important for any podcast, and often can be the bane of the existence of many hosts. On-Air comes with a great bookmarklet that lets you easily add links to your episode. With one click, the bookmarklet will add the URL and title of the page you’re on, and if you’ve selected text, it’ll add that too.</p>
