>Netflix is opening up another front in its ongoing battle with HBO: comedy. The New York Times reports that Parks and Recreation star Aziz Ansariâ€™s upcoming special Buried Alive will debut on Netflix on November 1st, making it the highest profile stand-up special on the service to date.

Netflix get's it. If I had the money, I'd buy Netflix stock, because they've done nothing but make great decisions in the past year. To think, there was a time when Netflix looked like it would go down in flames, and now is a producer of quality content at an **affordable** price. That's a difficult thing to do.

I can't wait to see what's in store for the company in the next year. I see very good things.
