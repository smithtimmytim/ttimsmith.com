> First held in 2006, MinneBar is an annual technology and software conference held in Minneapolis.  MinneBar, like other [BarCamps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp), is an (un)conference that is participant-ledand has a very loose structure.  BarCamps are held around the world from Swaziland to Seattle; MinneBar is rumored to be the largest in North America.  There are no keynote speakers or formal workshops (although we sometimes host minor web celebrities, and all sessions are led by people from the tech and business community.  The event is free an open to anyone with an interest.
